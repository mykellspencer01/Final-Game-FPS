Modular Sci-Fi Moon Base Level Kit v1.1

Update Notes:
In this update, we've added a Prefabs_Textured folder that includes all new textures and UVs for the architecture pieces. We've included the .PSDs with uv lines to help you create your own textures, as well. 
There are also a few new prefabs including a Force Field Wall and a laser prefab. 




Thank you for purchasing our level kit!

Simply drag the prefabs into your scene to use. 

We have designed the building prefabs to snap together easily using vertex snap. Hold the "V" key on your keyboard and choose a corner vertex to snap pieces together to matching vertices.

By default, most of our prefabs have a shiny metal looking material. We have UV mapped all of our models and included some different materials to add to your pieces, should you desire.

The DemoLevelDark scene has a large level built with the prefabs and you can see the different material options available, or create your own. 
Please set the color space to linear in your player settings to view the demo scene as we intended it to be viewed.

As a bonus, we have included a few game play prefabs including a UI canvas, a simple game manager and a Hotspot prefab.

The DemoLevelDark has the GameManager, GameUI and Hotspot prefabs in scene so you can easily see how they work. The scripts have been commented as well. Look at the in game objects in the scene to see how to set them up.

Set up the GameManager and GameUI prefabs in your scene, tag your player as player (make sure it has a collider) and drag a hotspot prefab into the scene. Type your message into the text box to have it display when the player collides
with it, in game.

Keys for demo scene -
1 - switch to player
2 - switch to animated camera
f - flashlight
n - switch to clean bright demo area
r - resets demo

Again, this was included simplay as a bonus and is not a core feature of the asset pack. 

Enjoy!
